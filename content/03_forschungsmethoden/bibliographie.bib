   abstract = {Moving mission-oriented enterprise software applications to cloud environments is a crucial IT task and requires a systematic approach. The foci of this paper is to provide a detailed review of extant cloud migration approaches from the perspective of the process model. To this aim, an evaluation framework is proposed and used to appraise and compare existing approaches for highlighting their features, similarities, and key differences. The survey distills the status quo and makes a rich inventory of important activities, recommendations, techniques, and concerns that are common in a typical cloud migration process in one place. This enables both academia and practitioners in the cloud computing community to get an overarching view of the process of the legacy application migration to the cloud. Furthermore, the survey identifies a number challenges that have not been yet addressed by existing approaches, developing opportunities for further research endeavours.},

   abstract = {Lately, a new computing paradigm has emerged: "Cloud Computing". It seems to be promoted as heavily as the "Grid" was a few years ago, causing broad discussions on the differences between Grid and Cloud Computing. The first contribution of this paper is thus a detailed discussion about the different characteristics of Grid Computing and Cloud Computing. This technical classification allows for a well-founded discussion of the business opportunities of the Cloud Computing paradigm. To this end, this paper first presents a business model framework for Clouds. It subsequently reviews and classifies current Cloud offerings in the light of this framework. Finally, this paper discusses challenges that have to be mastered in order to make the Cloud vision come true and points to promising areas for future research.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for organisations to carry out a structured feasibility study on Cloud migration and to decide Cloud Migration Strategy. Following the framework helps an organisation to decide whether Cloud migration is a feasible option for them, and if so, the best strategic approach towards Cloud migration. It is a crucial and sensitive part for any organisation to decide whether they should move to Cloud Computing platform. The decision requires strategic approach with proper feasibility study. Several technological, human, security and financial factors are involved in decision making process to move to the Cloud. The proposed framework helps an organisation to carry out a feasibility study to decide whether to move to the Cloud, and if so, what would be the best approach towards Cloud migration. The proposed framework addresses the factors that an organisation must explore to decide on Cloud migration. Cloud Computing has its own pros and cons. A whimsical decision to move to the Cloud may be disastrous for an organisation. Following the proposed framework will help organisations to carry out a structured and integrated feasibility study deal with the decision on Cloud migration.},

There have been a great number of empirical research articles published recently. There is also a large research community in empirical software engineering (ESE). In this paper, we identify both the overall landscape and detailed implementations of ESE, and investigate frequently applied empirical methods, targeted research purposes, used data sources, and applied data processing approaches and tools in ESE. The aim is to identify new trends and obtain interesting observations of empirical software engineering across different sub-fields of software engineering. We conduct a mapping study on 538 selected articles from January 2013 to November 2017, with four research questions. We observe that the trend of applying empirical methods in software engineering is continuously increasing and the most commonly applied methods are experiment, case study and survey. Moreover, open source projects are the most frequently used data sources. We also observe that most of researchers have paid attention to the validity and the possibility to replicate their studies. These observations are carefully analyzed and presented as carefully designed diagrams. We also reveal shortcomings and demanded knowledge/strategies in ESE and propose recommendations for researchers.},

Furthermore, research is sometimes critically reviewed for characteristics inherent to the methods. We adopt a taxonomy from the social sciences, termed here the ABC framework for SE research, which offers a holistic view of eight archetypal research strategies. ABC refers to the research goal that strives for generalizability over Actors (A) and precise measurement of their Behavior (B), in a realistic Context (C). The ABC framework uses two dimensions widely considered to be key in research design: the level of obtrusiveness of the research and the generalizability of research findings. We discuss metaphors for each strategy and their inherent limitations and potential strengths. We illustrate these research strategies in two key SE domains, global software engineering and requirements engineering, and apply the framework on a sample of 75 articles. Finally, we discuss six ways in which the framework can advance SE research.},

   abstract = {Cloud computing supports many unprecedented cloud-based vehicular applications. To improve connectivity and bandwidth through programmable networking architectures, Software-Defined (SD) Vehicular Network (SDVN) is introduced. SDVN architecture enables vehicles to be equipped with SDN OpenFlow switch on which the routing rules are updated from a SDN OpenFlow controller. From SDVN, new vehicular architectures are introduced, for instance SD Vehicular Cloud (SDVC). In SDVC, vehicles are SDN devices that host virtualization technology for enabling deployment of cloud-based vehicular applications. In addition, the migration of Virtual Machines (VM) over SDVC challenges the performance of cloud-based vehicular applications due the highly mobility of vehicles. However, the current literature that discusses VM migration in SDVC is very limited. In this paper, we first analyze the evolution of computation and networking technologies of SDVC with a focus on its architecture within the cloud-based vehicular environment. Then, we discuss the potential cloud-based vehicular applications assisted by the SDVC along with its ability to manage several VM migration scenarios. Lastly, we provide a detailed comparison of existing frameworks in SDVC that integrate the VM migration approach and different emulators or simulators network used to evaluate VM frameworks’ use cases.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The main goal of this paper is to study the cloud service discovery mechanisms. In this paper, the discovery mechanisms are ranked in three major classes: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. Moreover, in this classification, the peer-to-peer (P2P) and agent-based mechanisms are considered the parts of the decentralized mechanism. This paper investigates the main improvements in these three main categories and outlines new challenges. Moreover, the other goals are analyzing the current challenges in a range of problem areas related to cloud discovery mechanisms and summarizing the discussed service discovery techniques. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review (SLR) is utilized to detect, evaluate and combine findings from related investigations. The SLR consists of two key stages in this paper: question formalization and article selection processes. The latter includes three steps: automated search, article selection and analysis of publication. These investigations solved one or more service discovery research issues and performed a general study of an experimental examination on cloud service discovery challenges. Findings: In this paper, a parametric comparison of the discovery methods is suggested. It also demonstrates future directions and research opportunities for cloud service discovery. This survey will help researchers understand the advances made in cloud service discovery directly. Furthermore, the performed evaluations have shown that some criteria such as security, robustness and reliability attained low attention in the previous studies. The results also showed that the number of cloud service discovery–related articles rose significantly in 2020. Research limitations/implications: This research aimed to be comprehensive, but there were some constraints. The limitations that the authors have faced in this article are divided into three parts. Articles in which service discovery was not the primary purpose and their title did not include the related terms to cloud service discovery were also removed. Also, non-English articles and conference papers have not been reviewed. Besides, the local articles have not been considered. Practical implications: One of the most critical cloud computing topics is finding appropriate services depending on consumer demand in real-world scenarios. Effective discovery, finding and selection of relevant services are necessary to gain the best efficiency. Practitioners can thus readily understand various perspectives relevant to cloud service discovery mechanisms. This paper's findings will also benefit academicians and provide insights into future study areas in this field. Besides, the drawbacks and benefits of the analyzed mechanisms have been analyzed, which causes the development of more efficient and practical mechanisms for service discovery in cloud environments in the future. Originality/value: This survey will assist academics and practical professionals directly in their understanding of developments in service discovery mechanisms. It is a unique paper investigating the current and important cloud discovery methods based on a logical categorization to the best of the authors’ knowledge.},

The success of this data migration measure is relying upon a few viewpoints like planning and impact analysis of existing enterprise systems.

Cloud migration comes along with both challenges and advantages, so there are different academic research and technical applications on data migration to the cloud that will be discussed throughout this paper. By breaking down the research achievement and application status, we divide the existing migration techniques into three strategies as indicated by the cloud service models essentially. Various processes should be considered for different migration techniques, and various tasks will be included accordingly. The similarities and differences between the migration strategies are examined, and the challenges and future work about data migration to the cloud are proposed. This paper, through a research survey, recognizes the key benefits and challenges of migrating data into the cloud. There are different cloud migration procedures and models recommended to assess the presentation, identifying security requirements, choosing a cloud provider, calculating the expense, and making any essential organizational changes. The results of this research paper can give a roadmap for data migration and can help decision-makers towards a secure and productive migration to a cloud computing environment.},

The modules with bottlenecks in monolithic application cannot be extend separately as the application is an integral part, and different module cannot use different technology stack. To prolong the lifecycle of the monolithic applications, its need to migrated it to microservice architecture. Due to the complex logic and large number of third party framework libraries depended, get an accurate comprehensive of the application characteristics is challenging. The existing research mostly based on the static characteristics, lack of consideration of the runtime dynamic characteristics, and the completeness and accuracy of the static analysis is inadequate. To resolve above problems, we combined static and dynamic analysis to get static structure and runtime behavior characteristics of monolithic application. We employed the coupling among functions to evaluate the degree of dependence, and through function clustering to achieve the migration of legacy monolithic applications and its data to microservices architecture. Through the empirical study of migrate the typical legacy project to microservices, it is proved that we proposed method can offer precise guidance and assistance in the migration procedure. Experiments show that the method has high accuracy and low performance cost.},

   abstract = {Today, most of the organizations trust on their age old legacy applications, to support their business-critical systems. However, there are several critical concerns, as maintainability and scalability issues, associated with the legacy system. In this background, cloud services offer a more agile and cost effective platform, to support business applications and IT infrastructure. As the adoption of cloud services has been increasing recently and so has been the academic research in cloud migration. However, there is a genuine need of secondary study to further strengthen this research. The primary objective of this paper is to scientifically and systematically identify, categorize and compare the existing research work in the area of legacy to cloud migration. The paper has also endeavored to consolidate the research on Security issues, which is prime factor hindering the adoption of cloud through classifying the studies on secure cloud migration. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of thirty selected papers, published from 2009 to 2014 was conducted to properly understand the nuances of the security framework. To categorize the selected studies, authors have proposed a conceptual model for cloud migration which has resulted in a resource base of existing solutions for cloud migration. This study concludes that cloud migration research is in seminal stage but simultaneously it is also evolving and maturing, with increasing participation from academics and industry alike. The paper also identifies the need for a secure migration model, which can fortify organization’s trust into cloud migration and facilitate necessary tool support to automate the migration process.},

   abstract = {Companies built IT Center and operated an on-premise system because IT is a kind of asset. But the pace of change in management is accelerating and the pressure on cost efficiency in the IT sector is increasing. Cloud computing is considered to secure system reliability and reduce management costs. IT resources can be efficiently utilized and paid for used. Cloud computing for each service unit was considered as a way to meet an efficient utilization of IT resources without compromising existing system reliability when providing new services. Cloud system enables real-time orchestration, and has excellent security. As a hybrid method that implemented cloud computing while maintaining the existing infrastructure, it was possible to operate an uninterrupted system as a result of system construction Therefore, companies were deploying and migrating their intranet services to cloud servers. However, it is also true that cloud migration makes system complexity increase, and system reliability is compromised by the increase of management points especially securities. It is necessary to learn about practice-oriented cloud migration and how to maintain mixed security policies when maintaining on-premises systems is effective.},

   abstract = {This paper provides a systematic three-stage methodology for migrating complex real-Time industrial software systems from single-core to multi-core computing platforms. Single-core platforms have limited computational capabilities that prevent integration of computationally demanding applications such as image processing within the existing system. Modern multi-core processors provide increased computing capacity and allow the parallel execution of different applications within the system. However, this transition is non-Trivial and requires a systematic and well-defined migration process. This paper reviews some of the existing migration methods and provides a systematic multi-phase migration process with emphasis on software architecture recovery and transformation to explicitly address the timing and dependability attributes expected of industrial software systems.},

   abstract = {Cloud-based information management is one of the leading competitive differentiation strategies for firms. With the increasing criticality of information management in value creation and process support, establishing an integrated capability with cloud computing is vital for organizational success in the changing landscape of business competition. These issues have received scant attention, however. We draw on the resource-based view, dynamic capability hierarchy concepts, and the perspective of operand and operant resources to suggest a cloud value appropriation model for firms. We argue that, to appropriate business value from cloud computing, the firm needs to effectively deploy cloud computing and leverage cloud operant resources as firm capabilities in a hierarchical fashion toward the development of cloud computing-based service models in order to reliably achieve the desired business outcomes. We propose a model encompassing the principles of infrastructure and cloud platform deployment, integration and service orientation, and alignment with business processes that explain the linkage from cloud computing to firm performance. We test this approach to value creation with a cloud computing implementation assessment model using a sample of 147 firms that have implemented cloud computing in India. Our analysis uncovers a strategic value appropriation path from cloud technological capability to firm performance via cloud integration capability, cloud service portfolio capability, and business flexibility. This research offers new insights regarding the underlying mechanisms for how cloud computing affects firm performance via cloud-enabled capabilities and the business functions that are supported by cloud capabilities.},

@article{Rana2018,
   abstract = {Legacy systems refer to the applications designed for a particular
client that have been in use for a long period of time and developed
using obsolete technologies. They are often business-critical systems
therefore any changes here inevitably will affect the other parts of the
system. Although these systems are considered to be outdated, they are
too costly and risky for an organization to replace it. Cloud computing
provides a new platform for organization that promises flexible
scalability, business agility, high availability and reduction in costs.
Considering these benefits, migration of legacy systems to cloud is a
lucrative option for many organizations. However the architecture of
these legacy applications require a tested, fool-proof and risk free
approach for migration. Limited migration models or frameworks have been
proposed which caters issues of legacy systems migration to cloud
platform. Many of these cloud adoption techniques and models emphasize
on the generic phases and procedures on migrating the applications and
data to cloud, However some of these models are more flexible, and
provide better approaches compared to others. This research explores the
issues associated with the legacy applications with regards to their
migration on cloud and reviews the existing techniques and models that
have been proposed in this context.},

   abstract = {The cloud computing literature provides various ways to utilise cloud services, each with a different viewpoint, focus, and mostly using heterogeneous technical-centric terms. This hinders efficient and consistent knowledge flow across the community. Little, if any, research has aimed on developing an integrated process model which captures core domain concepts and ties them together to provide an overarching view of migrating legacy systems to cloud platforms that is customisable for a given context. We adopt design science research guidelines in which we use a metamodeling approach to develop a generic process model and then evaluate and refine the model through three case studies and domain expert reviews. This research benefits academics and practitioners alike by underpinning a substrate for constructing, standardising, maintaining, and sharing bespoke cloud migration models that can be applied to given cloud adoption scenarios.},

   abstract = {While cloud computing has certainly gained attention, the potential for increased uptake of the technology is still large. As a consequence , how to move and migrate to the cloud is an unanswered question for many organisations. Gaining an understanding of cloud migration processes from on-premise architectures is our aim here. For this purpose , we look at three provider-driven case studies based on the common three layers of cloud computing: Infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and software (SaaS) as a service. These shall be complemented by a fourth, independent systems integration perspective. We extract common migration process activities for the layer-specific processes and discuss commonalities, differences and open issues. The results presented are based on expert interviews and focus groups held with major international cloud solution providers and independent consultants.},

   abstract = {The use of big data, artificial intelligence, and new information and communication technologies has led to sustainable developments and improved business competitiveness. Until recently cloud services were classified as having special system requirements for a business organization, and was represented by different cloud computing architecture layers like infrastructure, platform, or software as a service. However, as the environment of IT services undergoes successive changes, companies have been required to reconsider their business models and consider adopting a cloud computing system, which can bring on business achievements and development. Regarding a decision-making model for adopting a cloud computing system, this paper analyzes critical variables in a hierarchical structure of decision areas: technology, organization, and environment, as well as seven factors and 23 attributes based on underlying decision factors of cloud computing adoption by AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and Delphi analysis. Furthermore, this research explores a comparative analysis between demanders and providers of cloud computing adoption. Resultantly, this study suggests several important factors for adopting a cloud computing system: top management support, competitive pressure, and compatibility. From the demander side, the high priority factor was compatibility and competitive pressure; in contrast, related advantage and top management support were regarded as priority factors for providers to service their cloud computing systems.},
